The Beatles, Responsive Web Design. 

 

What does it do & what need does it fulfill? 

This project uses a lot of learnt skills to create a mobile first responsive website for a 60’ band, being The Beatles. This website fulfills the needs of fans and prospects who are new to the site yet enjoy what they see. They are all able to view images of the band as well as listening to audio clips and watching videos of their music, each fan is able to sign up and receive their favorite bands merchandise. They’re able to contact them via their contact us page. 

 

Functionality of the project. 

This projects functionality of this website, it is a fully responsive website, via desktop, larger screen sizes all the way down to mobile screen sizes. Depending on the size there is a little amount of additional content such as the nav bar being spread across the top on a desktop to then being a dropdown nav via mobile. The sign up button via the middle of the screen, just under the main heading does work, as a drop box appears yet the sign up button at the top right doesn’t work as well which is a problem I have faced. The contact us page does let you submit your information; it will refresh once you have clicked submit yet it doesn’t lead to anyone/anywhere.

Testing. 

Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality as well as looked at in the landscape and portrait mode on iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPad Pro and responsive desktop (laptops: Dell, Mac). All the links were tested on all these devices along with music tracks audio controls and video player.  

 

 

 

Work based on other code. 

Only the modal fan club form code was re-used from the previous Whiskey Drop exercise. I modified its content and changed some of the code within it to reflect semantically what it was being used for such as the “whisky drop” being changed to “merchandise drop”.  I used the jumbox and changed each one to an image of the Beatles as the cover for the background along with the heading, short sentence and sign up button. 

 

 

What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase. 

After the user design experience, I had changed the “our music” page and added additional content being audio clips which were a problem at first as well as adding a YouTube video clip.
